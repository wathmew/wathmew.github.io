            <h1>Stuff I've Worked On</h1>
            <h2><a href="https://sharelm.github.io/">ShareLM</a></h2>
            <p>ShareLM is a Chrome plugin that lets you contribute your chatbot conversations to a dataset that exists for the benefit of the open-source community. Here's the <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-demo.17.pdf">paper</a> for it!</p>
            <p>I worked on it as part of <a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/">EleutherAI</a>'s Summer of Open AI Research and I added support for ChatGPT's code canvases.</p>
            <p>Since all the private companies are taking your chat logs as training data anyway (unless you opt out), you might as well contribute it! Plus, I like that ShareLM gives you more agency over your data; before it's sent to the database, it exists in your local Chrome storage for 24 hours and you can choose to remove it from the batch that will be uploaded. </p>
